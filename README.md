Stream Master

Its a nice release. The backend proxy is stable and the UI is working nicely.

There is lots more to do, documentation, this page, but it is coming along.

I mostly will be watching the discord server.

I will be publishing documentation next.

As far as the state of this code. I used SM to learn react and the newer c# stuff. Its not perfect right now and I welcome PRs ;)
